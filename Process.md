# Ethical Hacking Process: Capture the Flag and Penetration Testing

This document details the process followed during the Capture the Flag (CTF) and penetration testing project, including challenges faced and technologies used.

---

## **1. Reconnaissance**
- **Objective**: Identify open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Tools Used**:
  - **Nmap**: Scanned for open ports and services using `-sV` and `-A` options.
  - **Nikto**: Identified web server misconfigurations.
- **Challenges**:
  - Initial scans revealed minimal details for certain ports. Solution: Adjusted Nmap options to include aggressive mode and service detection.

## **2. Exploitation**
### **Port 19 (Chargen)**
- **Attack**: DDoS amplification using hping3 with randomized UDP packets.
- **Challenge**: Misconfigurations exposed sensitive data unexpectedly.

### **Port 3000 (Grafana)**
- **Attack**: Path traversal to access sensitive files.
- **Challenge**: Limited response to crafted requests required multiple iterations for successful traversal.

### **Port 5041 (Werkzeug)**
- **Attack**: Command injection to execute arbitrary commands.
- **Challenge**: Navigating directory structure after gaining access required trial and error.

### **Port 8081 (Apache Flink)**
- **Attack**: JAR upload for remote code execution.
- **Tool**: Metasploitâ€™s `apache_flink_jar_upload_exec` module.
- **Challenge**: Configuring the correct target and payload settings for a successful Meterpreter session.

### **Port 8082 (PHPMyAdmin)**
- **Attack**: Local File Inclusion via URL encoding.
- **Challenge**: Understanding and implementing URL encoding techniques to bypass whitelist checks.

## **3. Challenges and Resolutions**
1. **Network Connectivity**:
   - Difficulty in establishing reliable connectivity between virtual machines.
   - **Resolution**: Adjusted network settings to use bridged adapters and static IPs.
2. **Time Constraints**:
   - Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities within the deadline.
   - **Resolution**: Prioritized vulnerabilities with the highest impact and likelihood of success.
3. **Tool Compatibility**:
   - Certain tools required updates or alternative configurations.
   - **Resolution**: Used updated repositories and documentation for compatibility fixes.

---

## **4. Recommendations**
- Regularly update software to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
- Implement robust firewalls to restrict access to sensitive services.
- Use automated vulnerability scanners like Nessus for proactive detection.

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrated the importance of structured penetration testing in identifying critical vulnerabilities. The use of diverse tools and techniques showcased a comprehensive approach to ethical hacking, reinforcing the need for continuous security improvement.
